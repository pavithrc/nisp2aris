Problems
========

* Where is the latest DTD for the ARIS XML

* When exporting ARIS object which uses user defined attributes, the
  attribute types is identified as UUIDs - how is the label i.e. "NISP
  Organisation" mapped to the UUID representing the attribute? Is this
  part of a ARIS NAF filter, which should be distributed to external
  partners as well?
